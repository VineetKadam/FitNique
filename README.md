# FitNIQUE

FitNIQUE is an AI-powered health and fitness platform inspired by my passion for fitness and consistent training. As someone who regularly works out and tracks progress, I often found existing fitness apps either locked behind paywalls or lacking the customization and intelligence I needed. So, I built FitNIQUE â€” a free, smarter alternative that offers personalized workout plans, AI-generated diet suggestions, and wellness insights tailored to each user.
